The third online KubeVirt Summit is coming on March 29-30!

The KubeVirt Summit is a 2-day virtual event to discover,
discuss, hack and learn about managing virtual machines in Kubernetes using
KubeVirt.

This is an opportunity for us to share what we're working on and to promote ideas 
and discussion within the community in real-time. Whatever you're working on,
however you're using KubeVirt, no matter how esoteric, we'd like to hear
from you.
